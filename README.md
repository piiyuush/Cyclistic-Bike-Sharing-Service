Cyclistic's bike-share program in Chicago started in 2016, growing to 5,824 bikes across 692 stations. They offer single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Annual members are more profitable than casual riders. 
To maximize growth, they aim to convert casual riders into members. Understanding the differences between these groups and why casual riders would buy memberships is crucial. They plan to analyze historical trip data to identify trends and tailor marketing strategies accordingly.

This repository contains the code and documentation for a data analysis project conducted on Cyclistic's bike share data. The project is organized into several phases, including data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization, and recommendations. This README provides an overview of each phase and key findings.

- Segmentation of customer types (annual members versus casual riders).
- Aggregate rides and ride durations by customer type.
- Patterns of ride lengths by day of the week and month.
- Disparities in ride behavior between customer types.

## Phase 3: Data Visualization

Visual representations were crafted to showcase significant insights:
- Aggregate rides per day of the week for each customer type.
- Usage patterns based on time of day.
